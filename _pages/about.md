Hi, I'm Yist! I am a PhD student at [**École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)**](https://www.epfl.ch/about/), focusing on machine learning and computational biology. I am a recipient of the [**EDIC fellowship**](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-for-phd-students/) and am advised by **Prof. Maria Brbić** at the [**MLBio lab**](https://brbiclab.epfl.ch/). My current research centers on advancing AI models for single-cell analysis, including gene expression profiles, multi-omics data, and spatial transcriptomics, to uncover critical biological insights.

Before moving to Switzerland, I earned my Bachelor of Science degree with First Class Honors from the **Chinese University of Hong Kong**, majoring in [**Mathematics and Information Engineering**](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/programmes/bsc-in-mieg/).

<p>
  <span style="color:darkred; font-weight:bold;">Starting in March 2024, I dedicate 2-3 hours weekly to mentoring female students in my fields.</span> If you'd like someone to discuss your project or future academic plans with, feel free to reach out. TOGETHER WE RISE!

## Curiosities

Curiosity is the driving force behind my research, and the opportunity to collaborate with exceptional people is what fuels it even further! I am particularly curious about the following topics:

1. Cellular world—how single cells function, communicate, differentiate, teach, learn, and come together to form living organisms.
2. Graphs and randomness.
3. Non-human-centered research: benefit nature and wildlife, like social animal behavior and protecting natural habitats.
4. Intersection of machine learning and classical information/coding theories.

## Research Experience

Prior to joining EPFL, I explored a range of exciting topics that, although seemingly disparate, have collectively shaped my current academic journey. I have had the privilege of working closely with [Professor Sidharth Jaggi](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/sidharth-sid-jaggi), [Professor Li Yu](https://liyu95.com/), [Professor Ma Shiqian](https://sqma.rice.edu/), and [Professor Irwin King](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/irwin.king/home). During my undergraduate studies, I was also fortunate to receive invaluable guidance from [Professor Chandra Nair](http://chandra.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/), the director of my program.
