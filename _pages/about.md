I am a final-year undergraduate student at **the Chinese University of Hong Kong**, pursuing a major in **Mathematics and Information Engineering**. My current research interest lies in the **theory and application about general graph structure**, like graph learning problem, graph searching problem and graph nerual network. I love the intuitivity of graph, randomness, math and coding. Also, I enjoy solving  puzzles with learnt knowledges and applying my ideas to the real life. 

**Passion on creativity is the driving force of my research**.

I am now working on **optimization** and unbanlanced optimal transport problem under the supervision of [Prof. Shiqian Ma](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~sqma/) and [Dr. Minhui Huang](https://mhhuang95.github.io/) at UC Davis. Last year, I did a research project on **bioinformatics and artificial intelligence** supervised by [Prof. Yu Li](https://liyu95.com/) at CUHK. In that project, I developed a new random walk strategy on heterogeneous graph featured GNN to integrate multi-omics data at the single-cell level. Before that, I worked with [Prof. Sidharth Jaggi](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/sidharth-sid-jaggi) at CUHK (now at University of Bristol) and [Dr. Amitalok J. Budkuley](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~amitalok/) (now at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur) on **information theory**. In that project, I worked on the extension of Zyablov Bound which is based on concetenated code under general adversarial various channel.
