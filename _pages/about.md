Hi, I am Yist! I will start my PhD journey at **École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne** this September where I luckily received the [**EDIC fellowship**](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences/edic-for-phd-students/). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree at **the Chinese University of Hong Kong** major in [**Mathematics and Information Engineering**](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/programmes/bsc-in-mieg/). My current research interest lies in machine learning, graph algorithms and using tools from optimization, geometry and graph theory. I love the intuitivity of graphs, probabilistic model, discrete math, randomness and coding. To be more specific: 

1. I enjoy working on developing novel machine learning methods and graph algorithms with solid theoretical guarantee that can tackle practical computational challenges. 

2. I am fascinated by the intersection of machine learning and classical information theory. I am extremely curious on researching the capability of neural networks by classical theories.

It is my great honor to work closely with many respectful professors and have the chance to learn from them. In chronological order, I have worked with [Professor Sidharth Jaggi](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/sidharth-sid-jaggi) on Information Theory and Coding Theory, [Professor Li Yu](https://liyu95.com/) on Artificial Intelligence and Biomedicine, [Professor Ma Shiqian](https://sqma.rice.edu/) on Riemannian Optimization and Optimal Transport, and [Professor Irwin King](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/irwin.king/home) on Graph Neural Networks. I also luckily received numerous support from [Professor Chandra Nair](http://chandra.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/), the director of my pragramme, throughout my undergraduate study. 

My greatest thanks and respect to all of them!

<!-- I as currently working on (1) **Optimization** about Optimal Transport and Riemannian Optimization under the supervision of [Prof. Shiqian Ma](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~sqma/) at UC Davis (now at Rice University)  and (2) **Graph Neural Network** about the data augmentation for Hyperbolic GNNs and Equivariant GNNs supervised by [Prof. Irwin King](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/irwin.king/home) and [Prof. Yu Li](https://liyu95.com/) as my final year project. Last year, I did a research project on **Bioinformatics and Artificial Intelligence** supervised by [Prof. Yu Li](https://liyu95.com/) at CUHK. In that project, I developed a new random walk strategy on heterogeneous graph featured GCN to integrate multi-omics data at the single-cell level. Before that, I worked with [Prof. Sidharth Jaggi](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/sidharth-sid-jaggi) at CUHK (now at University of Bristol) on **Information Theory**. In that project, I worked on the extension of Zyablov Bound which is based on concetenated code under general adversarial various channel. -->
