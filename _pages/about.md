I am a senior undergraduate student at **the Chinese University of Hong Kong**, pursuing a major in **Mathematics and Information Engineering**. My current research interest lies in Machine Learning, Optimization, Graph Neural Network and Information Theory. I would like to present works with solid theoretical support and strong motivation. I love the intuitivity of graphs, probabilitistic models, randomness and coding. Also, I enjoy solving problems with learnt knowledges and applying my ideas to the real life. 

I as currently working on (1) **Optimization** about Optimal Transport and Riemannian Optimization under the supervision of [Prof. Shiqian Ma](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~sqma/) at UC Davis and (2) **Graph Neural Network** about Equivarient GNN and Weisfeiler-Leman test supervised by [Prof. Irwin King](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/irwin.king/home) and [Prof. Yu Li](https://liyu95.com/) as my final year project. Last year, I did a research project on **Bioinformatics and Artificial Intelligence** supervised by [Prof. Yu Li](https://liyu95.com/) at CUHK. In that project, I developed a new random walk strategy on heterogeneous graph featured GNN to integrate multi-omics data at the single-cell level. Before that, I worked with [Prof. Sidharth Jaggi](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/sidharth-sid-jaggi) at CUHK (now at University of Bristol) on **Information Theory**. In that project, I worked on the extension of Zyablov Bound which is based on concetenated code under general adversarial various channel.
