I am a junior undergraduate at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, pursuing a major in Mathematics and Information Engineering. My current research interest lies in Graph Nerual Network(GNN) both theoretically and practically. I love to solve puzzles with learnt knowledges and enjoy applying my ideas to real-life problems. Passion on creativity is the driving force of my research. 

I am now working on the unbanlanced optimal transport problem under the supervision of [Prof. Shiqian Ma](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~sqma/) and [Mr. Minhui Huang](https://mhhuang95.github.io/) at UC Davis. Last year, I did a research project on bioformatics and artificial intelligence supervised by [Prof. Yu Li](https://liyu95.com/) at CUHK. In that project, I develop a new random walk strategy on heterogeneous graph featured GNN to integrate multi-omics data at the single-cell level. Before that, I worked with [Prof. Sidharth Jaggi](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/sidharth-sid-jaggi) at CUHK (now at University of Bristol) and [Dr. Amitalok J. Budkuley](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~amitalok/) (now at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur) on information theory. In that project, I worked on the extension of Zyablov Bound which is based on concetenated code under general adversarial various channel.


Some fun facts about me
------
* I am a podcast producer, songwriter and a writer. Writing is the most important factor for me to be the current "myself". I also used to be a debator (too busy for now) and make videos about Olympic mathematics on Bilibili. 
* I enjoy living and travelling around. I have lived for more than one month in Jilin, Shanghai, Sanya, Shenzhen, Beijing, Hong Kong, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Toronto and Davis. 
* I watch modern dramas, movies, stage plays, musicals and band lives on a regular basis. They are also important parts of my life. 
* I have a sister who is 17 years older than me. Right, I'm the little daughtor of my family. 
* Some other self-identity: feminist, LGBTQ-supporter, libertarian and zoophilist. These identities are my self-demanding. I will never judge others by these criteria. I am always willing to contribute to the female community, LGBTQ community and animal protection activities. If there is something I can do, please always feel free to contact me.
