* I am a podcast producer, songwriter and a writer. Writing is the most important factor for me to be the current "myself". I also used to be a debator (too busy for now) and make videos about Olympic mathematics on Bilibili. 
* I watch modern dramas, movies, stage plays, musicals and band lives on a regular basis. They are also important parts of my life. 
* I have a sister who is 17 years older than me. Right, I'm the little daughter of my family. 
* Some other self-identity: feminist, LGBTQ-supporter, libertarian and zoophilist. These identities are my self-demanding. I will never judge others by these criteria. **I am always willing to contribute to the female community, LGBTQ community and animal protection activities. If there is something I can do, please always feel free to contact me**.
