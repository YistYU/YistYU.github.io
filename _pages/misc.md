* I am a podcast producer, songwriter and a writer. Writing is the most important factor for me to be the current "myself". I also used to be a debator (too busy for now) and made videos about Olympic mathematics in Bilibili (when I was around 15 years old). I write about my inner world in WeChat Blog ["世界的余数"](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/profile_ext?action=home&__biz=MzIyODU1MjI1NQ==&scene=124#wechat_redirect) since my 18th birthday. The articals are based on my self-reflection and observation of the life and world. 
* I watch modern dramas, movies, stage plays, musicals and band lives on a regular basis. They are also important parts of my life. Also, I love running marathon, swimming and bodybuilding. More specificly, I love all the acitivities that can make me physically stronger. 
* I have always been a curious thinker in topics on gender studies, religious studies and literature. **I am always willing to contribute to the female community, LGBTQ+ community and animal protection activities. If there is something I can do, please always feel free to contact me**. 
* My life purpose is to be a creator, an activist and a strong woman.
