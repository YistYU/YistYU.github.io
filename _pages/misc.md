* Writing is my most important tool for self-expression and finding my true identity. In the past, I was also an active debater (too busy to pursue it now). At the age of 15, I created videos about Olympic mathematics on Bilibili. Since my 18th birthday, I have been sharing my inner thoughts and reflections on life through the WeChat Blog, ["世界的余数"](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/profile_ext?action=home&__biz=MzIyODU1MjI1NQ==&scene=124#wechat_redirect).
* I enjoy staying physically active through activities such as running, swimming, hiking, cycling, and bodybuilding. I am particularly drawn to activities that help me build strength.
* Some of my areas of interest include gender study, religious study, politics, and literature. **I am passionate about advocating for women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights, animal protection, and civic engagement. If there is anything I can do to help, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.**
* My ultimate life goal is to be a scientist, an activist, and a strong woman.
