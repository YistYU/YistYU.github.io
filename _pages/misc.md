* Writing is my most powerful tool for making sense of the world. In the past, I was also an active debater. Since my 18th birthday, I have been sharing my thoughts through the WeChat Blog, 世界的余数. Frustrated by the limitations of censorship, start from Sep. 2023, I transitioned my writing channel to the newsletter platform [Substack](https://yist.substack.com/). I’ve been writing weekly posts for over five years, with more than 220 articles and 500,000 characters. 
* I love staying physically active, especially when it involves building strength. 
* After completing my current PhD in Computer Science, I dream of pursuing degrees in Gender Studies, Creative Writing and Literature, and Social Work. (Yes, I’m definitely greedy)
* **I am passionate about advocating for women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights, animal welfare, and civic engagement. If there is anything I can do to help, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.**
* My ultimate life goal is to be a good academic, a positive activist, and a strong woman.
