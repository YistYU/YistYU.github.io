* Writing is my most important tool for understanding the world. In the past, I was also an active debater. At the age of 15, I created videos about Olympic mathematics on Bilibili. Since my 18th birthday, I have been sharing my thoughts through the WeChat Blog, 世界的余数. Frustrated by the limitations of censorship, start from Sep. 2023, I transitioned my writing channel to the newsletter platform [Substack](https://yist.substack.com/).
* I enjoy staying physically active through activities such as running, swimming, hiking, cycling, climbing, and bodybuilding. I am particularly drawn to activities that help me build strength.
* Some of my areas of interest include gender study, religious study, and literature. **I am passionate about advocating for women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights, animal welfare, and civic engagement. If there is anything I can do to help, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.**
* My ultimate life goal is to be a good academic, a positive activist, and a strong woman.
