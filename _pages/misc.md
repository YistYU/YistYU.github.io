* Writing is my most powerful tool for making sense of the world. 
* I love staying physically active, especially when it involves building strength. 
* **I am passionate about advocating for women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights, animal welfare, and civic engagement. If there is anything I can do to help, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.**
* My ultimate life goal is to be a good academic, a positive activist, and a strong woman.
