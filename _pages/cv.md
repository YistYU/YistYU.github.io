RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
------
* **Subgraph Augmentation for Graph Neural Networks** (Sep. 2022 - Present)
  * Final Year Project Supervised by Professor Irwin King (CUHK).
  * Proposed subgraph sampling strategies based on Weisfeiler-Lehman similarity and subtree kernel for equivariant subgraph aggregation network to improve the expressive power and the scalability of the network. 
  * Conducted thorough experiments which showed that this strategy outperformed state-of-the-art sampling strategies published at ICLR 2022 on graph classification by 3% on TU datasets. It further reduced the space complexity up to 55% on dataset IMDB-MULTI and 10-20% training time on dataset NCI1 compared to the second best strategy. \[[Thesis](https://YistYU.github.io/files/FYP_Thesis.pdf)\]

* **Projection Robust Unbalanced Optimal Transport** (Feb. 2022 - Present)
  * Research Assistant to Professor Ma Shiqian (University of California, Davis)
  * Presented a new model called projection robust unbalanced optimal transport (PRUOT) to alleviate the curse of dimensionality for computing the Wasserstein distance between unbalanced distributions.
  * Illustrated a Riemmanian optimization algorithm RGAS-UOT for solving this model and proved its finite-time convergence to obtain the stationary point. Numerical experiments on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets were given to demonstrate the advantages of the PRUOT model in high-dimensional cases. **The work was presented in Preprint [4]**.

* **Multi-omics Integration with Random Walk and Graph Convolutional Network** (June, 2021 -- Present)
  * Research Assistant to Professor Li Yu (CUHK)
  * Presented **scMinerva**, an unsupervised framework for single-cell multi-omics integration. We propose a novel random walk strategy **omics2vec** that can flexibly "jump" among different omics and utilize information from the informative omics.
  * scMinerva achieved superior classification performance among 7 state-of-the-art methods on 6 real-world datasets and improved  classification accuracy up to 20% on dataset GSE128639 when classifying to 27 classes. 
  * **Best Project Award for Summer Research Internship of CUHK, 2020-21 (Top 10% out of 97 students and 46 projects)**.


* **Zyablov Bound in General Adversarial Various Channel** (June, 2020 -- Sep. 2020)
  * Research Assistant to Professor Sidharth Jaggi (CUHK).
  * Worked on extending Zyablov Bound which is based on concetenated code to the general adversarial various channels.
  * Revisited the basic assumptions for classic Zyablov Bound from coding theory and information theory, and examined them from classic channels to general adversarial various channels which are more practical in real-life transmissions.
