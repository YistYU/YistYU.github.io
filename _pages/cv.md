Education
------
* **Bachelor of Science** in Mathematics and Information Engineering
  * The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Sep. 2019- Sep. 2023 (expected)
  * Cumulative GPA: 3.737/4.000
* **Term Exchange** Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering, University of Toronto, Winter 2022
* **Relevant Courses:**
  * Computer Science and Information Science: Data Structure, Signals and Systems, Introduction to AI, Network Coding Theory (Grad Level), Operating System, Design and Analysis of Algorithms. 
  * Mathematics: Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, Mathematical Analysis, Probability, Optimization, Ordinary Differential Equation, Complex Analysis. 
* Ranked **Top 0.4%** among 163,000 science students} in the National College Entrance Exam.


Research experience
------
* **Expressive Equivariant Subgraph Aggregation Network** (Sep. 2022 - Present)
  * Final Year Project Supervised by Professor Irwin King (CUHK).
  * Proposed a new sampling strategy implemented in Python for equivariant subgraph aggregation network (ESAN) to improve the expressive power of GNN. The strategy is based on WL-similarity which goes beyond the 1-WL test for message-passing graph neural networks. 

* **Projection Robust Unbalanced Optimal Transport** (Feb. 2022 - Present)
  * Research Assistant to Professor Ma Shiqian (University of California, Davis)
  * Proposed a novel unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) formulation that has the potential to alleviate the curse of dimensionality.
  * Proposed two algorithms for solving this problem and analyze their complexity for obtaining an $\epsilon$-stationary point. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets are conducted to demonstrate the advantages of our new UOT formulation in high-dimensional cases.

* **Multi-omics Integration with Random Walk and Graph Convolutional Network** (June. 2021 -- Present)
  * Research Assistant to Professor Li Yu (CUHK)
  * Presented **scMinerva**, an unsupervised framework for single-cell multi-omics integration. We propose a novel random walk strategy **omics2vec** that can flexibly "jump" among different omics and utilize information from the informative omics.
  * Conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method. scMinerva achieves superior classification performance among the seven state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and improves the classification accuracy by 7% on average.
  * **Best Project Award for Summer Research Internship of CUHK, 2020-21**.


* **Zyablov Bound in General Adversarial Various Channel** (June. 2020 -- Sep. 2020)
  * Research Assistant to Professor Sidharth Jaggi (CUHK).
  * Extend Zyablov Bound which is based on concetenated code to the general adversarial various channel.
