Education
------
* **Bachelor of Science** in Mathematics and Information Engineering
  * The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Sep. 2019- Sep. 2023 (expected)
  * Cumulative GPA: 3.737/4.000
* **Term Exchange** Winter semester exchange program in Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering, University of Toronto (UoT)
* **Relevant Courses:**
  * Computer Science and Information Science: Data Structure, Introduction to AI (MIE369, UoT), Design and Analysis of Algorithms (ECE345, UoT), Signals and Systems, Network Coding Theory (Grad Level), Computer Networks.  
  * Mathematics: Linear Algebra, Mathematics Analysis, Differentiation Analysis, Probability Theory, Complex Variables with Applications, Ordinary Differential Equation, Discrete Mathematics, Algebraic Structures, Stochastic Process.
* Ranked **Top 0.4%** among 163,000 science students} in the National College Entrance Exam.


Research experience
------
* **Expressive Equivariant Subgraph Aggregation Network** (Sep. 2022 - Present)
  * Final Year Project Supervised by Professor Irwin King (CUHK).
  * Proposed a new sampling strategy implemented in Python for equivariant subgraph aggregation network (ESAN) to improve the expressive power of GNN. The strategy is based on WL-similarity which goes beyond the 1-WL test for message-passing graph neural networks. 

* **Projection Robust Unbalanced Optimal Transport** (Feb. 2022 - Present)
  * Research Assistant to Professor Ma Shiqian (University of California, Davis)
  * Proposed the projection robust unbalanced optimal transport formulation that has the potential to alleviate the curse of dimensionality for computing the Wasserstein distance.
  * Proposed two algorithms for solving this problem and analyze their complexity for obtaining an $\epsilon$-stationary point. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets are conducted to demonstrate the advantages of our new UOT formulation in high-dimensional cases.

* **Multi-omics Integration with Random Walk and Graph Convolutional Network** (June. 2021 -- Present)
  * Research Assistant to Professor Li Yu (CUHK)
  * Presented **scMinerva**, an unsupervised framework for single-cell multi-omics integration. We propose a novel random walk strategy **omics2vec** that can flexibly "jump" among different omics and utilize information from the informative omics.
  * Conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed method. scMinerva achieves superior classification performance among the seven state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and improves the classification accuracy by 7% on average.
  * **Best Project Award for Summer Research Internship of CUHK, 2020-21 (Top 10% out of 97 students and 46 projects)**.


* **Zyablov Bound in General Adversarial Various Channel** (June. 2020 -- Sep. 2020)
  * Research Assistant to Professor Sidharth Jaggi (CUHK).
  * Extend Zyablov Bound which is based on concetenated code to the general adversarial various channel.
